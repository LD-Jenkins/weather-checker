# Weather Checker

This app is now live at https://ld-jenkins.github.io/weather-checker/ !

## Purpose

Whether you're curious about the weather happening right outside your door or somewhere across the globe, I've got an app for you.

With the Weather Checker v1.0 simply type in a city name to be shown the current weather and the weather for the next five days for that location.

Once a city is searched it will be archived in a list where you may simply click the list item to search that city again.
